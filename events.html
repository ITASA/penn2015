											<a class="image right"><img style="width: 600px;" src="images/Tim Be Told.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3>Tim Be Told</h3>
											<p>
												Tim Be Told is a group of acoustic singer/songwriters that began out of a college apartment in Charlottesville, VA with Tim Ouyang and Andrew Chae. From there, the band's music started to spring up all over the country through word of mouth and grassroots efforts with their first album “Getting By.” The band was growing steadily as they released their second record "From The Inside" in 2009 which featured their popular single "Analyze." 
Due to an unforeseen conflict in 2011, the band went underground, and at the end of 2013, the band reemerged with a brand new album “Mighty Sound.” Composed out of the frustrations of time lost and tears shed, they resolved not to make the album a lament about the past 3 years. Instead, the sound would be triumphant. Therefore, the band birthed anthemic songs like, “Fools Marching”, “Wasted”, “Mighty Sound”, and “The Battle Hymn.” 
This year, Tim Be Told launched their 1/52 Project. They will release something new every week for the coming year as a deliberate response to the time they lost in their 3 years of silence. It is a testament to the band's mantra, "Hope is alive."
